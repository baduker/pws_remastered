A fresh take on poorlydrwanlines.com comic image scraper based on my previous [script](https://github.com/baduker/poorlywrittenscraper).

There are going to be some major changes and improvements over the first edition.

**What's new?**

1. The script will come with a pre-loaded list of source urls to speed up the scraping part.
2. There's going to be a simple .json file based database of comic names, comic urls, source image urls, dates (published & downloaded), and comic number
3. The scraping algorithm is going to be rewritten.
4. A new, colorful logo is going to great you.
5. A built-in zip feature for easier sharing of downloaded comics.

**Road map**

An overview of what's been done so far.

- [x] DONE! :collision:
- [ ] TO-DO :shit:
